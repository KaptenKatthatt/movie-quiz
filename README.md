My first individual assignment in JS at Medieinstitutet was to make a guess the person quiz to get to know our class mates better. I replaced my classmates with movie stars when making the app public.
My favorite things in the project was learning how to structure a project in multiple files to make it more managable in the long run and the page change animations with CSS.

I later converted it into TS.

How? JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, animations.

What? Individual assignment

Where? Medieinstitutet(The Media Institute), Frontend developer trade school.

When? Fall 2025
