## Bugs

## Start

- Input 3 char user name for high score. Save in array. After selection nbr of questions.

- Put a pin in every photo at start page, like notice board. Make notice board background with CSS? Mobile friendly?

## End screen

Put the high score list in a sidebar to the right to make endContainer shorter and make Restart game more visible.

## App general

Add animationend eventlistener to all animations for safe removal after use.

### DONE

- Change font on question mark to a heavy dark font. Sans serif bold, inky black. More in style with image borders.

Bug: Score point animation triggers when you press wrong question

Cards get very long in high resolution. Fixed with height on cards.

Can't base selector on length-1 since the list is sorted by nbr and the last nbr can be anything. Figure out some other way to select the last score

Mobile first
media queries, fewer cards on start page? None=?
